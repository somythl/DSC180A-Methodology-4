**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic I've covered this quarter in my domain has been replicating the figures of our research paper. I've never seen such powerful ways to visualize such abstract data so that it clearly represents some kind of trend. To state it in a couple of words, the most interesting topic I've covered has been the importance of data visualizations.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I think for quarter 2, I would like to elaborate more on comorbodities and how a subgroup might have more prevalence of a certain outcome in the intensive care unit over another. I feel only defining 6 subgroups is too limited, so when we analyze MIMIC-IV, I'm sure we'll be able to find a lot more.  

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
Given what I said to the previous question, a different approach I would take is a much deeper dive into the data; essentially, much more EDA. I think it's important to really develop an understanding of what we're looking at. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I think an overlooked technique that I'd be interested in using in our quarter 2 project is cross-referencing with other research papers. I think looking at other metrics that have been defined, especially since things like SOFA, and OASIS don't account for comorbidities, would be useful in trying to explore larger trends here.
